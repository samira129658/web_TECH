<p> <b>Bangladesh, country of south-central Asia, located in the delta of the Padma (Ganges [Ganga]) and Jamuna (Brahmaputra) rivers in the northeastern part of the Indian subcontinent.
   The riverine country of Bangladesh (“Land of the Bengals”) is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, and its people are predominantly Muslim.
    With the partition of India in 1947, it became the Pakistani province of East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan), one of five provinces of Pakistan, separated from the other four by 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of Indian territory.
    In 1971 it became the independent country of Bangladesh, with its capital at Dhaka.<b></p>
    <h4>5 Best Places to Visit in Bangladesh</h4>
    <h5> Covered in greenery as well as undulating hills.
    Bangladesh echoes with the Muslim call to prayer as well as Buddhist chants, and is one of the most mysterious and wonderful lands in Asia.
    Bangladesh is the neighbor of India,
    but you will find a less developed and more laid back atmosphere here.
The country had a tumultuous past that saw it gain freedom from first the British and then from Pakistani rule.
When you consider that all this happened in the 20th century,
it just goes to show what a turbulent recent past Bangladesh has had to endure.
As a result, it offers a slice of authentic life to travelers who want an untainted image of the region.
The people of Bangladesh are famously friendly and welcoming and the country is full of cultural wonders such as the tea covered highlands of Srimangal to the gorgeous golden sands of Cox’s Bazar,
which is actually the third longest beach in the world.
Other highlights include bustling cities like Dhaka as well as areas of rural paradise like the Sundarbans National Park.
